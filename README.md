This is a jupyter notebook containing a machine learning model that learns the probability distribution of the 
scalar phi^4 statistical physics model in 2 spacial dimensions. The whole idea was explained in the paper 
"Introduction to Normalizing Flows for Lattice Field Theory" (arXiv:2101.08176). 

I implemented the algorithm described in their paper with TensorFlow and Keras. During the implementation I 
wrote some custom layers and functions.
